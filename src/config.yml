# TP = teleport
# OutOf = when a player is inside relation claim and a player tries to teleport out (in any way)
# Into = when a player is outside of a relation claim and is trying to teleport into it (in any way)
# Default: True
# If you want to allow players to teleport out of enemy claim for example:
# Change enemyDenyTPOUTOF: true to -> enemyDenyTPOUTOF: false
# Also, the config options under each TP denying option is the message displayed if, and only if, the teleportation is blocked. So if you have an option set to false, ---
# -- the message under it will not be displayed ever.
